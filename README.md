# CodeNoMad - Scientific Image Classifier

## Team Intro
Team CodeNoMad consists of Mahima Bhagwat, a first-year student from the Electronics and Telecommunications department.

## Domain
The project falls under the domain of Health & Wellness, aiming to address critical challenges in lab analysis for scientific tests.

## Problem Statement
In a world facing a shortage of labs for analyzing scientific tests, timely results are crucial for emergency surgeries and treatments. Lab professionals encounter high workloads, limited resources, and cost constraints. The Scientific Image Classifier is developed to enhance healthcare outcomes by providing faster and accurate slide classification.

## Tech-stack
- **Frontend:** PyQT5
- **Backend:** Python
- **Libraries:** Ultralytics, OS, Matplotlib, Pandas

## Demo
The project showcases a deep learning-based Scientific Image Classifier using a pre-trained YOLO model. It is trained on the BioForbs dataset, achieving an accuracy of 86.842% at the 10th epoch. The classifier can predict 6 major classes, including CT-scans and MRI tests, making it convenient, cost-effective, and highly accurate for lab professionals.
